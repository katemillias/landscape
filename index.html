      <h1>Van Gogh's <i>"Wheatfield With Crows"</i> <b>Re-imagined</b> as <i>"Birds and Grass"</i> in Kate's simple style</h1>

      This field with crows was reimagined as a much simpler setting. The main focus is the yellow grass and the black birds, against the multicolored sky. There are some brown triangles, and some green parts.
